# Task
# Custom Dict Class and Unit Tests

This repository contains two Python scripts:

1. `dict2.py`: This script defines a custom dictionary class called `Dict2`, which allows storing key-value pairs without using the built-in Python dictionary class. It implements functionalities such as storing key-value pairs, accessing values based on keys, throwing custom exceptions for non-existing keys, and supporting iteration over keys.

2. `test.py`: This script contains unit tests for the `Dict2` class using the Python `unittest` library. It ensures that the `Dict2` class behaves as expected and passes all specified requirements.

## Usage

To use the `Dict2` class and run the unit tests:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the scripts.
4. Run the following command to execute the unit tests:

   ```bash
   python test.py
   ```

   This command will run the unit tests and display the test results in the terminal.

## File Structure

- `dict2.py`: Contains the implementation of the `Dict2` class.
- `test.py`: Contains unit tests for the `Dict2` class.

## Note

- Both scripts should be stored in the same directory to ensure proper import functionality.
Feel free to modify and extend the scripts as needed for your own use case!
